rtl8811AU_rtl8821A-linux
========================

Initial repository based on Realtek driver rtl8811AU_linux_v4.3.0_10674.20140509.

Primarily intended for my Edimax EW-7811UTC AC600 USB wireless interface, but should work for any device based on the
RTL8811AU or related chips.

I needed a better-performing driver than the v4.2.2 version available for download from edimax.com, and this one
works great.

I found that similar drivers from ASUS-based sources were missing the RTL8821A extensions required for my Edimax.
